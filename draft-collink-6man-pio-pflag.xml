    <abstract>
 <t>
This document defines a ‘P’ flag in the Prefix Information Option of IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs).
The flag is used to indicate that the network prefers that hosts acquire global addresses using DHCPv6 PD instead of using SLAAC for this prefix.

      <name>Introduction</name>
<t>
IPv6 hosts, especially mobile hosts, usually have multiple global IPv6 addresses
 (e.g. stable addresses, privacy addresses, 464XLAT addresses, addresses for virtual systems etc).
</t>

<t>
On large networks, individually tracking these addresses can create scalability issues for the infrastructure, because routers must maintain multiple entries (neighbor cache, SAVI mappings, VXLAN routes, etc.) for each host. 
<xref target="I-D.collink-v6ops-ent64pd"/> discusses these challenges and proposes a solution that uses DHCPv6 PD <xref target="RFC8415"/>.
</t>

<t>
On small networks, scaling to support multiple individual IPv6 addresses is less of a concern, because many home routers support hundreds of neighbor cache entries. On the other hand, address space is more limited compared to the number of hosts connected - the smallest home network might only have /60 prefixes, or even just a single /64.
</t>

<t>
A host cannot know in advance which address assignment method is most appropriate for the 
network, so there must be a mechanism for the network to communicate with this to the host.

    <section anchor="rationale">
<name>Rationale</name>
<t>
The information is passed to the host via a P flag in the Prefix Information Option (PIO). The reason is as follows:
</t>
<ul>
<li>
The information should be contained in the Router Advertisement because it must be available to the host before it decides to form IPv6 addresses from the prefix using SLAAC. Otherwise, the host might form IPv6 addresses from the PIO provided and start using them. This is suboptimal because if the host later acquires a prefix using DHCPv6 PD, it can either use both the prefix and SLAAC addresses, reducing the scalability benefits of using DHCPv6 PD, or can remove the SLAAC addresses, which would be disruptive for applications that are using them.

</li>
<li>
This information is specific to the particular prefix being announced. For example, a network might want to assign global addresses via DHCPv6 PD, but use SLAAC for ULA addresses. Also, in a multihoming situation, one upstream network might choose to assign addresses via prefix delegation, and another via SLAAC.

</li>
</ul>

    </section>
<section anchor="host">
<name>Host Behaviour</name>
   <section anchor="track">
   <name>Tracking and requesting prefixes</name>
<t>
The host SHOULD NOT use SLAAC to obtain IPv6 addresses from prefix(es) with the P bit set.
</t>

<t>

For each network it is currently connected to, the host MUST keep a list of every PIO it has received with the P flag. Each time the client receives a Router Advertisement containing a PIO with the P bit set that is not in the list, and every time a previously-received PIO with the P bit set becomes deprecated:


</t>
<ul>
<li>
If the client has not previously received any delegated prefixes from the network, it SHOULD start DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation.

</li>
<li>
If the client has already received delegated prefix(es) from one or more
servers, it MUST consider this change in PIOs a change in configuration
information as described in <xref target="RFC8415" section="18.2.12"/>, i.e. it MUST perform
a REBIND.  This allows the host to obtain new prefixes if necessary, e.g. when
the network is being renumbered.  It also refreshes state related to the
delegated prefix(es).
</li>
</ul>

<t>
Whenever a Prefix Information Option’s Valid lifetime reaches zero, or its P flag changes to 0, the prefix is removed from the list. When there are no such prefixes, the host SHOULD stop the DHCPv6 client if it has no other reason to run it. The lifetimes of any DHCPv6 prefixes already obtained are unaffected.
</t>

<t>
When a host requests a prefix via DHCPv6 PD, it MUST use the prefix length hint  <xref target="RFC8415" section="18.2.4"/> to request a prefix that is short enough to form addresses via SLAAC.
</t>
<t>
The P flag is meaningless for link-local prefixes and any Prefix Information Option containing the link-local prefix MUST be ignored as specified in <xref target="RFC4862" section="5.5.3"/>.

</t>

   </section>

<section anchor="received">
<name>
Using received prefix(es)
</name>

<t>
For every delegated prefix:

</t>

<ul>
<li>
The host MAY form as many IPv6 addresses from the prefix as it chooses.
</li>
<li>
The host MAY use the prefix to provide IPv6 addresses to internal components such as virtual machines or containers.
</li>
<li>
If the host is capable of acting as a router, and doing so is allowed by local policy, it MAY use the prefix to allow devices directly connected to it to obtain IPv6 addresses, e.g., by sending a Router Advertisement containing the prefix to a connected interface.
</li>

</ul>
</section>

</section>

<section anchor="mhoming">
<name>
Multihoming
</name>

<t>
In multi-prefix multihoming, the host generally needs to associate the prefix with the router that advertised it (see for example, <xref target="RFC6724"/> Rule 5.5). If the host supports Rule 5.5, then it SHOULD associate each prefix with the link-local address of the DHCPv6 relay from which it received the packet.
